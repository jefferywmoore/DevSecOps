# What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) is an approach to the culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility across the organization, and through all aspects of the IT lifecycle. It takes the ideas behind DevOps, including the agility, continuous integration and deployment, and ensures that IT or cyber security plays an integrated role.

DevOps principles target rapid and frequent cycles, where work is done in small chunks, called "sprints." Using this type of pacing, effective security can't be tacked-on at the end of the project -- it needs to be a shared responsibility and integrated from start-to-end of a project, and across the organizaiton. It's a mindset change that means that Cyber Security resources work in tandem with development and operations resources, building secuirity into the foundation of the DevOps processes.
