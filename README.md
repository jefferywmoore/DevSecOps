# What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) is an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility across the organization, and through every phase of the software development lifecycle -- from initial design through integration, testing, deployment, and software delivery. It draws from ideas underpinnning DevOps, including agility, continuous integration and deployment, and ensures that security plays an integrated role.

DevOps outlines a software development process and an organizational culture shift that speeds the delivery of higher quality software by automating and integrating the efforts of development and IT operations teams â€“ two groups that traditionally practiced in solos, separately from each other. DevOps principles target rapid and frequent cycles, where work is done in small chunks, called "sprints" with the aim of reducing cycles to weeks or even days. Using this type of pacing, effective security can't be tacked-on at the end of the project -- it needs to be a shared responsibility and integrated from start-to-end of a project, and across the organizaiton. It's a mindset change that means that Cyber Security resources work in tandem with development and operations resources, building secuirity into the foundation of the development and DevOps processes.

DevSecOps automatically bakes in security at every phase of the software development lifecycle, enabling development of secure software at the speed of Agile and DevOps. Addressing security issues as they emerge reduces cost (by catching problems before they are pushed into production), as well as the overall risk and attack surface) (https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devsecops).
